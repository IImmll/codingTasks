# Iris Species Classifier Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model to classify Iris species as either 'Iris-setosa' or 'not-Iris-setosa'. Understanding logistic regression and its application in binary classification problems is fundamental in the field of machine learning. This example showcases how to encode labels, split data, train a model, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and the following packages:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these packages using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, you can run the notebook `iris_logistic_regression.ipynb` to train the model and make predictions. The notebook includes detailed steps on data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

### How to Run
1. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to see the workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

### Example Output
- Confusion Matrix: 
  ```
  [[19, 0],
   [0, 26]]
  ```
- Accuracy: 100%
- Precision: 100%
- Recall: 100%

## Results
The logistic regression model achieved perfect classification accuracy, with 100% precision and recall. This suggests the model is highly effective for this dataset and could serve as a benchmark for more complex classification algorithms.
